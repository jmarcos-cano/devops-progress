## Description

Here you can find **"Devops Transformation Plan"** progress for E4M exclusively.


!!! info
    - There are still some gaps that I need to answer before giving an actual and complete plan; however I can assure the following areas are the ones we care.
    - We will need to work through iterations and discuss the plan with the team; this is the first step to get the plan in place.
    - Ill try my best to keep it up to date.


The plan will circle around specific areas:

- [Platform Architecture.](glossary/#platform-architecture)
- [Continuous Integration (CI)](glossary/#continuous-integration)
- [Continuous Delivery (CD)](glossary/#continuous-delivery)
- [Automated Testing (AT)](glossary/#automated-testing)
- [Infrastucture](glossary/#infrastucture-as-code)
- [Monitoring & Logging (M&L)](glossary/#monitoring-and-logging)
- Others.
